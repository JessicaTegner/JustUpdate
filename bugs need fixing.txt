#1:
command:
justupdate build

Rename the generated .exe and windows manifest file from win.exe and win.exe.manifest to %APP_NAME%.exe and %APP_NAME%.exe.manifest
Posible solutions:
make the user supply the wanted .exe name (not recommented)
Asume the name from APP_NAME (most likely solution)

So the metadata files name becomes metadata.PLATFORM_NAME_SHORT.ju
